## How Volatility Dynamics Change Path-Dependent Prices

This project compares arithmetic Asian call option pricing under Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and GARCH(1,1) volatility dynamics. Using yfinance data and Monte Carlo simulation, it analyzes how volatility clustering affects the distribution of average prices and resulting option values. Results highlight why market makers quote using GBM for consistency while employing GARCH for volatility forecasting and risk calibration.
